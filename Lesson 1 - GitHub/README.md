# Lesson 1
## Welcome
Woah, you made it. A cool about GitHub is that each folder in a repository can have a README file. If you're reading this on the GitHub website, everything looks all **fancy**, right? That's GitHub Markdown. [Here's a guide on GitHub Markdown.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) Isn't that just ~~radical~~ awesome?

## Basic Git Terms
This entire lesson plan depends on you being able to submit **Pull Requests** to this repository. In order to do that you're going to need to know a basic few terms.

### Commit
A commit is a change, or a bunch of changes, bundled into a nice package. It contains only the changes you made. For example, I added this example in a commit. The first part of submitting a **pull request** is creating a commit, or multiple commits.

### Pull Request


### Clone
Cloning a repository is simply taking my repository and downloading it *through Git*. This can be done through the GitHub desktop app. It's important to use Git to clone my repository because it makes things easier when you want to **push** your **commits** to my repository.
