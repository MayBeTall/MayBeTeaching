# Lesson 1
## Welcome
Woah, you made it. A cool about GitHub is that each folder in a repository can have a README file. If you're reading this on the GitHub website, everything looks all **fancy**, right? That's GitHub Markdown. [Here's a guide on GitHub Markdown.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) Isn't that just ~~radical~~ awesome?

## Basic Git Terms
This entire lesson plan depends on you being able to submit **Pull Requests** to this repository. In order to do that you're going to need to know a basic few terms.

### Clone
Cloning a repository is simply taking a repository and downloading it *through Git*. This can be done through the GitHub desktop app. This puts all the files on your computer.

### Commit
A commit is a change, or a bunch of changes, bundled into a nice package. It contains only the changes you made. For example, I added this example in a commit. You can view the commit [here](https://github.com/MayBeTall/MayBeTeaching/commit/eb5b3cbdd5b87dfb7d529d817e7d44913f0159a8). Notice how it highlights the line I changed and puts a darker green over the specific text I added? Fancy stuff! The first part of submitting a **pull request** is creating a commit, or multiple commits.

### Push
Commits may hold change, but **pushes** are what bring change. A **push** publishes your commits to GitHub, making them *official*. After that, anyone can see and **pull** your commits.

### Pull
A **pull** is the act of downloading the latest **commits** from a repository, updating your cloned repository to match GitHub's.

### Branch
A branch is a like a group of commits. A branch holds a bunch of commits and keeps them separated from the rest of the branches. You can **merge** branches later. For our purposes, I will control the **master** branch and you will make a branch of your own to make changes to. You'll then make a **pull request** to merge your branch into the **master** branch.

### Pull Request
A **pull request** is when you request that a branch be merged into another branch. In this case, you'd be requesting that your branch be merged into **master**. At this point I can review your changes and make comments and suggestions.
