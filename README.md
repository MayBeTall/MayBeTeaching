# I MayBeTeaching Web Development
## You may learn
This is my first time trying this, so you also may not. This repo is intended for my IRL friends but if I pick up a few random people along the way that's cool too.

# What we're focusing on
## HTML
The content of a website. Sort of like a house. You've got the roof, the walls, the rooms, the furniture - the skeletons in the closet.

## CSS
The *look* and *layout* of a website. If we're keeping the house analogy, changing CSS would allow you to change the color of the walls. How high the walls are. Where things are placed inside the house.

## JavaScript
JavaScript allows you to change the HTML and CSS of a webpage while a user is on the website. If we're keeping the house analogy, JavaScript turns it into a haunted house. It can move the furniture, rooms, walls. It can add or remove things. It's black magic.

## Photoshop
Since I'm not a designer, we're using a Photoshop design I found to make our website. This is where we will get our content, images, fonts, ect. I'll be teaching you some neat tricks along the  way.

# What do I need to get started?
## Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
I don't care, they'll all work.
